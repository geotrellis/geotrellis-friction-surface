# GeoPySpark Tobler Friction Surface

Here we experiment with replicating the Scala functionality in this project in GeoPySpark notebook.
The intent is to provide an interactive environment where different approaches to constructing friction surface can be experimented with, visually inspected and validated.

Currently the notebook code assumes functionality from [`feature/vector-pipe`](https://github.com/locationtech-labs/geopyspark/tree/feature/vector-pipe) branch of GeoPySpark.
